## Usage

### Light Card

A compact light tile split into two clickable halves by a subtle divider. Supports `light`
entities only. Brightness is shown as a thin vertical hint bar on the card's left edge.

**Interactions**

The card has **three interactive regions** — the **upper half**, the **lower half**, and the **centered icon** — each of which spans the full card area (padding and hint bars included). Every region responds to **single tap**, **double tap**, and **long press**, and each gesture can be reassigned in the editor's **Switch Behavior** section.

| Region | Single tap (default) | Double tap (default) | Long press (default) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upper half | Increase brightness to the next 5% | Full on (100%) | More info |
| Lower half | Decrease brightness to the next 5% | Turn off | More info |
| Icon | Toggle | More info | More info |

Available actions: **Increase brightness**, **Decrease brightness**, **Full on (100%)**, **Turn off**, **Toggle**, **More info**, and **Nothing**.

For **toggle-only** lights (no brightness support), the upper-half single tap defaults to **Full on** and the lower-half single tap to **Turn off**; the left hint bar shows full when on and empty when off.

Minimal config:

```yaml
type: custom:ted-light-card
entity: light.living_room
```

All options:

```yaml
type: custom:ted-light-card
entity: light.living_room
name: Living Room          # optional, defaults to entity friendly name
icon: mdi:floor-lamp       # optional, defaults to entity icon
theme: ted-style           # optional, visual styling: ted-style (default) | ha
```

`theme` (optional) — **Visual styling**, selectable in the editor's **Visual** section:
- `ted-style` (default): a self-contained "Ted's Home Theater" look (Windows 11 Fluent / Mica-dark) that looks the same regardless of your Home Assistant theme.
- `ha`: follow the active Home Assistant theme (surfaces, text, and accent color).

Brightness is shown as a thin vertical hint bar pinned to the card's left edge (it fills bottom→up with the light's brightness; it is not interactive). `brightness_color` (optional, in the **Visual** section) sets its color when the light is on:
- `theme` (default): the theme accent color.
- `light`: the light's current color (its `rgb_color`), falling back to a warm tone.
- `other`: a custom color — set `brightness_color_custom` to an `[r, g, b]` array (chosen via the editor's color picker).

`show_hint` (optional, default `false`, in the **Visual** section): show a matching stripe up the right edge with **+** / **−** hints, indicating the top half raises brightness and the bottom half lowers it.

The icon is centered in the card and lights up when the light is on. `icon_color` (optional, in the **Visual** section) sets its on color:
- `theme`: the theme accent color.
- `light` (default): the light's current color (its `rgb_color`), falling back to a warm tone.
- `other`: a custom color — set `icon_color_custom` to an `[r, g, b]` array.

`background_on` (optional, in the **Visual** section): override the card's background color while the light is **on**. Pick a color with the editor's color picker (stored as a `#RRGGBB` hex string). When unset, the theme background is used.

Also in the **Visual** section: `show_name`, `show_icon`, and `show_state` (all default **on**) toggle the name, centered icon, and the state/brightness label; `name_scale` and `icon_scale` (percent, default `100`) scale the name text and icon size. `width` and `height` (px, default `100` × `120`) set the card's fixed size; the card always renders at this size and centers itself in its container (stack, masonry, or Sections grid cell).

### Switch Behavior

The editor's **Switch Behavior** section lets you reassign the action for every region × gesture. It contains three groups — **UP behavior**, **DOWN behavior**, and **Icon behavior** — each exposing a **Single tap**, **Double tap**, and **Long press** action picker. The config keys are `up_tap` / `up_double_tap` / `up_hold`, `down_tap` / `down_double_tap` / `down_hold`, and `icon_tap` / `icon_double_tap` / `icon_hold`. Any option left at its default is omitted from the saved YAML.

```yaml
up_tap: increase           # increase | decrease | full_on | full_off | toggle | more_info | none
down_double_tap: toggle
icon_hold: none
```

### Memory (dimmable lights)

For dimmable lights you can choose the brightness the light turns **on** to. The editor shows a **Memory** section (only for brightness-capable lights) with three modes:
- `off` (default): turn on at the light's last brightness (standard Home Assistant behavior).
- `static`: always turn on to a fixed brightness — set `memory_value` (1–100 %, default 100).
- `helper`: turn on to the value of an `input_number` / `number` helper — set `memory_entity`. The helper's value is read as a **percentage** (1–100).

```yaml
memory_mode: static        # off | static | helper
memory_value: 60           # static mode, 1–100 %
# or
memory_mode: helper
memory_entity: input_number.living_room_brightness
```

### Cover Card

A compact cover tile split into two clickable halves by a subtle divider. Supports `cover`
entities only (blinds, shades, shutters, curtains, garage doors, …). The current position is
shown as a thin vertical hint bar on the card's left edge.

**Interactions**

The card has **three interactive regions** — the **upper half**, the **lower half**, and the
**centered icon** — each spanning the full card area (padding and hint bars included). Every region
responds to **single tap**, **double tap**, and **long press**, reassignable in the editor's
**Switch Behavior** section.

| Region | Single tap (default) | Double tap (default) | Long press (default) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upper half | Open more (next 5%) | Fully open | More info |
| Lower half | Close more (next 5%) | Fully closed | More info |
| Icon | Toggle | More info | More info |

The **icon's Toggle** is smart: while the cover is moving it **stops**, otherwise it opens (to the
configured memory position) or closes. Available actions: **Open more**, **Close more**, **Fully
open**, **Fully closed**, **Toggle**, **Stop**, **Tilt open**, **Tilt closed**, **More info**, and
**Nothing**. Tilt actions appear in the editor only for tilt-capable covers.

For **open/close-only** covers (no position support), the upper-half single tap defaults to **Fully
open** and the lower-half to **Fully closed**. Tilt-only covers use their tilt position as the
primary value driven by the up/down regions.

Minimal config:

```yaml
type: custom:ted-cover-card
entity: cover.living_room_blinds
```

All options:

```yaml
type: custom:ted-cover-card
entity: cover.living_room_blinds
name: Living Room Blinds   # optional, defaults to entity friendly name
icon: mdi:blinds           # optional, defaults to a device-class icon
icon_open: mdi:blinds-open # optional, shown while the cover is open
theme: ted-style           # optional, visual styling: ted-style (default) | ha
```

`icon_open` (optional) sets a different icon to show while the cover is open — e.g. `icon: mdi:garage`
with `icon_open: mdi:garage-open`. When unset, `icon` (or a device-class default) is used in all states.

`theme`, `position_color`, `icon_color`, and `show_hint` work as in the Light Card (all in the
editor's **Visual** section). `position_color` (`theme` default / `other` custom) colors the
position bar when open; `show_hint` (**on by default**) shows a right-edge stripe with **up/down
chevron** hints. The position bar fills from the bottom up with the cover's current position.

`background_open` (optional, in the **Visual** section): override the card's background color while the cover is **open**. Pick a color with the editor's color picker (stored as a `#RRGGBB` hex string). When unset, the theme background is used.

Also in the **Visual** section: `show_name`, `show_icon`, and `show_state` (all default **on**) toggle the name, centered icon, and the state/position label; `name_scale` and `icon_scale` (percent, default `100`) scale the name text and icon size. `width` and `height` (px, default `100` × `120`) set the card's fixed size; the card always renders at this size and centers itself in its container (stack, masonry, or Sections grid cell).

### Switch Behavior (cover)

The **Switch Behavior** section reassigns the action for every region × gesture, grouped into **UP
behavior**, **DOWN behavior**, and **Icon behavior**. Config keys are `up_tap` / `up_double_tap` /
`up_hold`, `down_tap` / `down_double_tap` / `down_hold`, and `icon_tap` / `icon_double_tap` /
`icon_hold`. Any option left at its default is omitted from the saved YAML.

```yaml
up_tap: open_step          # open_step | close_step | open | close | toggle | stop | tilt_open | tilt_close | more_info | none
icon_hold: stop
```

### Memory (position-capable covers)

For covers that support `set_cover_position` you can choose the position the cover **opens** to. The
editor shows a **Memory** section (only for position-capable covers) with three modes:
- `off` (default): open fully (100%).
- `static`: always open to a fixed position — set `memory_value` (1–100 %, default 100).
- `helper`: open to the value of an `input_number` / `number` helper — set `memory_entity` (read as
  a percentage 1–100). Changing the position from the card also writes the new value back to the helper.

```yaml
memory_mode: static        # off | static | helper
memory_value: 70           # static mode, 1–100 %
# or
memory_mode: helper
memory_entity: input_number.blinds_position
```


## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build      # produces dist/ted-cards.js
npm run watch      # rebuild on change (with sourcemaps)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
```
